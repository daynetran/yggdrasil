    "My final project is a fun, Berkeley-related showcase of contingent valuation of students' willingness-to-pay for a campus-wide ski lift. I remember back to three years ago, when reading about Berkeley upon my acceptance, I came across some students' proposal for something called BearLift. Here is the link to the comment under Carol Christ's Reddit Ask-Me-Anything from three years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/e7i1o4h/?context=3. \n",

    "When we began covering nonparametric analysis in class, I knew that I can put two and two together and apply this nonparametric technique to a very playful topic. So, I first developed a survey through Google Forms and collected 57 responses from fellow Berkeley students (https://forms.gle/jSU8tq5m7x37S58X6). The form has far greater detail about the pros and cons of a potential ski lift. I randomly assigned students to different initial prices ($100, $200, $300, $400, $500), then would direct them to the respective following price points (half or double) depending on their answer."

    "We went out and gathered real data about an interesting topic that could have a real impact on the everyday lives of Berkeley students. We then conducted a nonparametric analysis of the data and found some measure of centeredness, by optimizing the posterior probabilities and cumulative distribution. We found that the 50th percentile of willingness-to-pay for BearLift lies in the ($100, $150) interval, and we can chart the survivorship function of the willingess-to-pay as we change the proposed price of the annual fee.\n"
